# Software Engineering - Spring 2025  
## 윷놀이 Project  

This repository contains the **윷놀이 Game Project** for the Software Engineering course (Spring 2025). The project applies **Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD)** principles to develop a digital version of the traditional Korean board game *윷놀이*.  

## 📌 Project Overview  
- Develop a **윷놀이 game** using OOAD techniques.  
- Players can specify the **number of participants** (2 to 4) and **number of game pieces** (2 to 5).  
- The game board follows the **standard 윷놀이 layout**, displaying each player's piece locations.  
- Players take turns using:  
  - **"Random Throw" button** for random results.  
  - **"Manual Throw" button** to select specific results for testing.  
- The game supports:  
  - **Piece grouping (말 업기)**  
  - **Capturing opponents’ pieces**  
  - **Winning conditions**: The first player to move all pieces to the goal wins.  
- Players can **restart** or **exit** after a game finishes.  

## 📅 Project Timeline  
### ✅ First Due (5th April)  
- Create a **GitHub project page** and post it on the e-class project board.  

### ✅ Mid Due (10th May)  
- Submit a **fully functional version** using **Java Swing**.  
- Include:  
  - All **source code** and **data files**  
  - **Executable file**  
  - **Gameplay demonstration video**  

### ✅ Final Due (Late May)  
- Add explanations on **UI modification impacts** and provide **two UI demonstration videos**.  
- Implement **two different UI toolkits** (e.g., Swing, JavaFX, Eclipse SWT).  
- Submit:  
  - All **source code** and **data files**  
  - **Project documentation**, including:  
    - Project Overview  
    - Use Case Model  
    - Design & Implementation Report  
    - Testing Report  
    - GitHub Project Report  

### 🎤 Presentation Day (Early June)  
- Evaluation based on:  
  - **Functionality**  
  - **Project documentation**  
  - **Final presentation**  

## 🛠 Development Guidelines  
- Follow **OOAD principles** and document design decisions.  
- Implement using **MVC architecture** (separating UI and logic).  
- Support **multiple UI toolkits** to demonstrate modularity.  
- Ensure **JUnit testability** for core logic.  
- Enable **custom board shapes** (e.g., pentagon, hexagon).
